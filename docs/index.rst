Introduction
************

Ubold is a fully featured premium admin template built on top of awesome Bootstrap 5.0.1 and Django v3. It's crafted using modern web technologies HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. The theme includes a beautiful dashboard, many ready-to-use hand-crafted components, widgets, pages, etc. The components can be used very easily on any page. The theme is fully responsive and customizable.

It's powerful and super flexible, which suits best for web applications including CRM, CMS, Admin Panels, Dashboards, etc. It is fully responsive, which means that it looks perfect on mobiles and tablets. Also, we tried to implement this by keeping the concept of modularity in mind, this enables you to reduce the development time and cost.

This documentation is guidelines for all users who can even be a beginner or experienced Django developers.
